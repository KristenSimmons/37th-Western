# Vision 

### What is the vision of this project?
I want to provide a site for users to reserve short term rentals directly from the home owner, without fees from a third party site. 

### What pain point does this project solve?
This would create a rental scenario that is more cost efficient for the guests and provide higher profit margins to the owners. 

### Why should we care about your project?
This project will have a positive effect on both users and home owners.

# Scope 
### What will this site do?
This site will show available homes from my portfolio.
### What will this site not do?
This site will not show homes that I do not manage. 

# Minimum Viable Product 
### What will your MVP functionality be?
At minimum, I would like to display a few houses with photos and descriptions. I would also like a link to calendars for the homes to show availability. 

### What are your stretch goals?
Getting more than 5 houses displayed with photos and calendars!
